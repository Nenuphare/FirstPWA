## TP PWA API

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/DonTitoSama/pwa_exo.git
cd pwa_exo
```

## Steps for read-only access

Start Local Server:

- Open XAMPP / WAMPP / MAMPP.
- Ensure your local server environment (like Apache and MySQL) is up and running.
- Install LiveServer Extension:

If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the LiveServer extension if you haven't already. You can install it via the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) by searching for "Live Server".
Run LiveServer:

After installing the LiveServer extension, navigate to your project directory (pwa_exo).
Right-click on the index.html file in Visual Studio Code.
Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
This will launch your default browser and open the project using LiveServer.
These steps will allow you to access the project in read-only mode on your local server. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your server environment is properly configured and that LiveServer is installed correctly in Visual Studio Code.
